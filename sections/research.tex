\location{September 2018 – Present | New York, NY}
Worked with \textbf{\href{https://as.nyu.edu/content/nyu-as/as/faculty/allen-mincer.html}{Prof Kyle Cranmer}} 
to work on contributing to a statistical analysis package pyhf (Python HistFactory) in order to facilitate generating statistical models with uncertainties due to several different sources of background noise. \\
I am working on implementing a gaussian process in order to interpolate a continuous parameter describing the effects of different sources of background, given signal data.

\location{September 2016 – Present | New York, NY}
Worked with \textbf{\href{https://as.nyu.edu/content/nyu-as/as/faculty/allen-mincer.html}{Prof Allen Mincer}} 
to perform an analysis of the efficiency of algorithms used at the ATLAS
experiment at CERN. \\
Determined thresholds needed to combine algorithms such that we get a higher
efficiency. \\
Contributed Algorithm Design to ATLAS Collaboration at the Large Hadron
Collider.
